# TODO

* Keep cursor in same relative place in node when lateral swapping?
* Can make test-watch only print errors? Quiet up all the green?
* I think highlight should do the whole block
* Dot repeatability of swaps
* If inside a function, cursor in the middle of a line, move_out goes to the outer function
* treewalker at the top of a yml file highlights the whole file
